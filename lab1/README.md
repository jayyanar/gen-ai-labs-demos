## Example ZeroShot Prompting - Summarize the Text

- Prompting Example --> summarize the text below: "Amazon Comprehend uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract insights about the content of documents. It develops insights by recognizing the entities, key phrases, language, sentiments, and other common elements in a document. Use Amazon Comprehend to create new products based on understanding the structure of documents. For example, using Amazon Comprehend you can search social networking feeds for mentions of products or scan an entire document repository for key phrases."

- Completion --> "Amazon Comprehend is a natural language processing (NLP) service that extracts insights from text. It recognizes entities, key phrases, language, sentiments, and other common elements in a document. Use Amazon Comprehend to create new products or search social networking feeds for mentions of products."

## Example FewShot Prompting - QA Bot

- Prompting Example --> Below is SageMaker Low-code ML FAQ:

##
Q: Will my data (from inference or training) be used or shared to update the base model that is offered to customers using Amazon SageMaker JumpStart?
No. Your inference and training data will not be used nor shared to update or train the base model that SageMaker JumpStart surfaces to customers.

Q: Can I see the model weights and scripts of proprietary models in preview with Amazon SageMaker JumpStart?
No. Proprietary models do not allow customers to view model weights and scripts.

Q: Which open-source models are supported with Amazon SageMaker JumpStart?
Amazon SageMaker JumpStart includes 150+ pre-trained open-source models from PyTorch Hub and TensorFlow Hub. For vision tasks such as image classification and object detection, you can use models such as ResNet, MobileNet, and Single-Shot Detector (SSD). For text tasks such as sentence classification, text classification, and question answering, you can use models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT.

Q: What solutions come pre-built with Amazon SageMaker JumpStart?
SageMaker JumpStart includes solutions that are preconfigured with all necessary AWS services to launch a solution into production. Solutions are fully customizable so you can easily modify them to fit your specific use case and dataset. You can use solutions for over 15 use cases including demand forecasting, fraud detection, and predictive maintenance, and readily deploy solutions with just a few clicks. For more information about all solutions available, visit the SageMaker getting started page. 

Q: What built-in algorithms are supported in Amazon SageMaker Autopilot?
Amazon SageMaker Autopilot supports 2 built-in algorithms: XGBoost and Linear Learner.

Q: Can I stop an Amazon SageMaker Autopilot job manually?
Yes. You can stop a job at any time. When an Amazon SageMaker Autopilot job is stopped, all ongoing trials will be stopped and no new trial will be started.
